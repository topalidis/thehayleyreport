        The French affectionately call their beloved homeland "l'Hexagone" because of its distinct six-sided shape. Each corner of France has its own unique character: the rugged and outdoorsy French Alps; sun-drenched and slow-paced Provence; the glamorous and gorgeous Côte d'Azur coastline; and idyllic Alsace, a pastoral region where storybook hamlets are tucked away in the vine-covered rolling hills.

Paris and Versailles are must-see destinations for a first trip to France. Other classic travel itineraries include stops at fashionable seaside resorts, fairy-tale castles, and glorious Gothic cathedrals.

        Appreciated for its elegance and joie de vivre, Paris is a grand European capital filled with architectural masterpieces like the Eiffel Tower and the Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Reflecting the city's rich heritage, the Louvre (one of the top museums in Paris) contains an exceptional fine arts collection, while the Musée d'Orsay and the Musée de l'Orangerie display treasures of French Impressionist art.

Other charms of Paris are its atmospheric medieval quarters and graceful boulevards. Quintessential tourist experiences include shopping at bookshops in the Latin Quarter, strolling the Champs-Elysées, and people-watching from a sidewalk café terrace on the Boulevard Saint-Germain-de-Prés.

        Like the scene of a fairy tale, magnificent castles are scattered throughout the densely forested landscape of the Loire Valley. Stretching for 280 kilometers, from Sully-sur-Loire to Chalonnes-sur-Loire in Anjou, the Loire Valley is the largest UNESCO-listed site in France.

The region boasts an incredibly rich cultural heritage. During the 15th and 16th centuries, France's kings built sumptuous country retreats here purely for entertainment and enjoyment.

Extravagant châteaux, such as the grandiose Château de Chambord and the emblematic Château de Chenonceau, offer insight into the opulence of the Renaissance-era French court.

French nobles and elites also built stately manor houses, such as the majestic Château of Cheverny and the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau in an idyllic setting with a water-filled moat.

      </p>

      The Bordeaux region is a beautiful bucolic corner of France, where grandiose castles preside over rolling, vine-covered hills. Scenic tree-shaded paths traverse the countryside and follow alongside the Garonne River, as well as its placid canals. Many travelers enjoy exploring this area on a leisurely cycling itinerary.

The region has two exceptional UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the elegant city of Bordeaux, with more than 350 buildings classified as historical monuments, and the little country village of Saint-Émilion, 51 kilometers from Bordeaux, which is packed with notable churches and monasteries.
